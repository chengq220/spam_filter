# Basic Spam Filter Using Naive Bayes Classifier
Steps
1. Compute all the store weights or characteristics that can be indicative of a spam email or message
2. Create a good learning website(doesn't have to be fancy)
3. Use Python to code the computation (Bayes theorem and multiplication between different keywords and its probability) --> communicate between python(back-end) and front-end probably in reactJS
